# Image-to-Image Translation using cGAN (pix2pix)

## Task-04

This project demonstrates image-to-image translation using a conditional
Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). The generator learns to translate an
input image into an output image, while the discriminator distinguishes
between real and generated images.

The implementation is done from scratch using PyTorch and executed in
Google Colab. For demonstration purposes, dummy input data is used, so
the generated outputs appear noisy. With real paired datasets and proper
training, meaningful image translation can be achieved.

## Tools Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Google Colab

## Output
The model successfully generates output images from input images, verifying
the working of the cGAN pipeline.
