# Text Generation using GPT-2

## Task Description
Fine-tuned a pre-trained GPT-2 transformer model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- GPT-2
- PyTorch
- Google Colab

## Dataset
A custom text dataset (`data.txt`) containing domain-specific sentences.

## Methodology
1. Loaded GPT-2 pre-trained model and tokenizer
2. Tokenized custom dataset
3. Fine-tuned GPT-2 using Hugging Face Trainer
4. Generated text using probabilistic sampling

## Sample Output
Artificial intelligence is a real possibility that could radically transform the way we live and we live and we live this world.

One of the most important things about artificial intelligence is that it is very smart and pretty powerful. And when you put it together, you can you do anything.

So, what do you think of this?
